### Developing a Todo List Web Application using just HTML,CSS and JavaScript  

### Steps    

### Developing  Static Part  


[x] First create html boilerplate  
[x] Create div element to take user input for todo list item  
[x] Create Input element in that div element   
[x] Create "Add" Button   
[x] Create status list to let users know how their todo list will look like  
[x] Create css folder
[X] Create style.css file in CSS folder  
[x] Import thpuat style.css file in index.html file  
[x] Give some styles to div element, button and static list  

That concludes static part of our web application    

### Developing Logic (JavaScript part)   

  [x] Create a JS folder  
  [x] Create script.js file  
  [x] Import that file to index.html file
  [] Give button an on click event  
  [] When user clicks on button, means onlclick event happens, call a function  
  [] Give function a straightforward name. for example addItemToList  
  [] Start defining logic in that addItemToList function  
  [] first create a variable named "todoTitle" to take and store user input  
  [] Second: create li element  
  [] Append text node with variable todoTitle to that li element  
  [] Get ol (by classname) where newly created li needs to be appended  
  [] Will have to remove old user input with empty string
